I am Rachel Benson and I'm running for Robbinsdale City Council, ward 2. I live in Robbinsdale with my husband Jace and our children Avery and Brody. I will work on preserving and maximizing the following for our community members;

* Health
* Safety
* Well-being

Robbinsale is a great city to live, work and visit. But there is more to be done to better the quality of life for our residents.

I seek your input on what you feel makes Robbinsdale a great city and what issues you wish to see addressed.

Regards,

Rachel Benson
