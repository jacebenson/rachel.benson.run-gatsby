  Every robust city I have lived in and visited had one thing in common, a
  thriving transit system.


  I use metro transit and I advocate for getting light rail to Robbinsdale.


  First this will benefit businesses by bringing customers here.


  Second, it will benefit citizens by providing them an easy commute.


  Third, this will appeal to people looking to call Robbinsdale home.
